                <h2>The Unexpected Meeting</h2>
                <p>We met for the very first time at an RCRIC workshop. That day, something unexpected happened—she fell for me before I even realized what was happening. At that moment, I didn’t know that someone in that room had already chosen me with her heart.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-section" id="scene2">
                <h2>Becoming Best Friends</h2>
                <p>Slowly, she approached me. She tried to be friendly, to talk, to get closer. And gradually… we became best friends. The kind of best friends who laugh too much, flirt without admitting it, and enjoy every moment together without realizing that they’re already building something deeper.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-section" id="scene3">
                <h2>Overcoming Fears</h2>
                <p>But love wasn’t easy for me. I was afraid. I had been betrayed before, and the scars were still fresh. I didn’t want to fall again… because falling hurts. Yet somehow, with her, I felt safe.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-section" id="scene4">
                <h2>Opening Up and Falling</h2>
                <p>I opened up to her. I told her everything—my past, my fears, my broken pieces. And instead of stepping away, she held them gently. She listened. She consoled me. She accepted all my scars as if they were a part of my story, not a reason to leave. She made me believe that I could love again—that I deserved to love again.</p>
                <p>And then… I fell. Not suddenly, but slowly. Beautifully. I fell for the kindness in her voice, the innocence in her smile, and the softness in her eyes. She accepted me exactly as I am, without trying to change me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-section" id="scene5">
                <h2>The First Date and Changes</h2>
                <p>We went on our first date as “best friends,” but our hearts already knew what was happening between us. That day, when I kissed her for the first time and held her close to my chest, something changed inside me. In that moment, I realized I wanted to hold her—not just for that moment, but for a lifetime.</p>
                <p>For her, I left my habit of smoking because she cared about me more than I cared about myself. For her, my perspective changed. My goals changed. I started seeing a better future—our future. I became determined to be successful, not just for myself, but so I could stand proudly beside her… and one day, marry her.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-section" id="scene6">
                <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                <p>On 3rd August 2025, we finally entered a committed relationship. That day wasn’t just a date—it was the beginning of our story. A story that continues to grow every single day.</p>
                <p>She changed my life. She healed me, supported me, and loved me when I doubted myself the most. And today, I am genuinely happy—because I have her.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-section" id="finalMessage">
                <h2>Final Message</h2>
                <p>So Rizin, my love…<br>I love you soooo much.<br>Thank you for choosing me.<br>Keep believing in me, because I promise I will make you happy, and you will never regret choosing me as your life partner.</p>
                <p>Forever yours, ❤️</p>
